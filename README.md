# Exam Portal

## About
This project was created as a part of a python internship under Ankyah Infinity Private Limited.
The online test portal contains teacher and student logins. The teacher can login to create objective tests, the students can attempt the tests. The tests are auto graded and teachers and students can see marks, both in table format and in graphical view.

The project uses a HTML-CSS-Bootstrap template for the frontend(https://coderthemes.com/greeva/), and the Django(Python) for the backend.
